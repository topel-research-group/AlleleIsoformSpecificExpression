## Presence/absence of copepods

65h		With vs. without copepod
89h		With vs. without copepod
Compare the timepoints, too?
* Confirm that only _Calanus finmarchicus_ copepod was used in this experiment (implied by NCBI page)

# PRJEB33171
## Sex-related genes

Comparisons used in paper:
* Asexual large cell      No change vs. salinity shift
  * T1 and T2
* Sexual vs. asexual large cell under salinity shift
  * T1 and T2

(T1 = 40h, T2 = 52h)
